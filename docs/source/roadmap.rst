Expected Roadmap
****************

Below is the minimum viable state for each version release.


* v 0.2.x

    * Project is in a viable state to import and use in other projects, even if
      only for only basic response testing.
    * **BaseTestCase** and **IntegrationTestCase** are roughly stable.

        * Further functionality may still be added at a later date. But core
          logic is present.

    * At least some documentation exists for BaseTestCase and IntegrationTestCase.

* v 0.3.x

    * Project is in a viable state to test both basic responses and selenium
      browser responses.
    * **LiveServerTestCase** is roughly stable.

        * Further functionality may still be added at a later date. But core
          logic is present.

    * Documentation for BaseTestCase and IntegrationTestCase is fairly thorough,
      if not complete.
    * At least some documentation exists for LiveServerTestCase.

* v 0.4.x

    * Project is in a viable state to test basic responses, selenium browser
      responses, and CSV file downloads.
    * **Csv/ReportTestCase** is roughly stable.

        * Further functionality may still be added at a later date. But core
          logic is present.

    * Documentation for LiveServerTestCase is fairly thorough, if not complete.
    * At least some documentation exists for Csv/ReportTestCase.

* Unsure of roadmap past this point. To be decided at a later date.
