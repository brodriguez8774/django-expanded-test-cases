Expected Roadmap
****************

Below is the minimum viable state for each version release.


* v 0.7.x

    * Project is in a viable state to test basic responses, selenium browser
      responses, and has form helper functions.
    * Documentation for LiveServerTestCase is fairly thorough, if not complete.

* v 0.8.x

    * Project is in a viable state to test basic responses, selenium browser
      responses, CSV file downloads, and has form helper functions.
    * **Csv/ReportTestCase** is roughly stable.

        * Further functionality may still be added at a later date. But core
          logic is present.

    * Documentation for all prior releases is fairly thorough, if not complete.
    * At least some documentation exists for Csv/ReportTestCase.

* Unsure of roadmap past this point. To be decided at a later date.
