Expected Roadmap
****************


Below are upcoming features for future releases, on the path to a 1.0 release.


**Required Functionality**:

* [ ] Documentation for existing functionality is fairly thorough, if not
  complete.

  * Currently a bit behind. Only so much time in a day. Oops.

  * Should include occasional examples when applicable.

* [ X ] Package is in a viable state to test basic responses, JSON responses,
  and selenium browser responses.

* [ X ] Package has customizability (when appropriate), because testing is
  definitely not a "one size fits all projects" deal.

* [ X ] Package has been tested and actively used in multiple real-world
  projects of non-trivial size, made/maintained by multiple individuals.

  * Is known to actively be used and tested on at least one project of
    medium-to-large size (Greater than 1000 separate tests, most each with inner
    subtests).

  * Also known to actively be used in multiple others projects varying between
    small-to-medium size.


**Ideally Also Includes**:

* **Csv/ReportTestCase** - Similar design philosophy, for testing responses
  that return a csv/excel type file format.

  * CSV testing is known to be do-able. Just need to put in the time to create
    functionality.

  * Unsure about excel, but logic is theoretically similar, so it makes sense
    to make both of these at the same time.
